                I am Md. Sayed Ullah Arif.I am student.Some days ago i am complete of diploma in computer enginerring from
                <ins><strong>Laxmipur govt.polytechnic institute</strong></ins> and BSS(Degree)from <ins><strong>Saikat
                University College</strong>

                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do,
                to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream;
                I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the
                moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming
                from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do
                experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in
                summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late;
                I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’
                noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like
                delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and
                the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
            </p>
            <p>
                I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman
                Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books.
                I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read
                people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some
                teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
